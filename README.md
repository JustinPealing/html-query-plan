# html-query-plan

html-query-plan is a JavaScript library for showing Microsoft SQL Server execution plans in HTML.

To use in a web page:

 - Find the latest release [here](https://github.com/JustinPealing/html-query-plan/releases/latest).
 - Include `qp.css` and `qp.min.js`
 - Call `QP.showPlan`, passing the container in which to show the plan and the query plan XML (as a string). 

```
<div id="container"></div>
<script>
    QP.showPlan(document.getElementById("container"), '<ShowPlanXML...');
</script> 
```

See the `examples` folder for complete examples.

## Options

Additional options can be passed using the 3rd argument:

```
<div id="container"></div>
<script>
    var options = {
        jsTooltips: false
    };
    QP.showPlan(document.getElementById("container"), '<ShowPlanXML...', options);
</script> 
```

| Option | Default | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| jsTooltips | true | Set to `false` to use CSS tooltips. | 

## Running XSLT separately

Under the covers, html-query-plan is an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet (`qp.xslt`), which can be used to pre-render the plan html. Javascript is still needed to draw the connecting lines. To do this, follow the above steps but call `QP.drawLines` instead:

```
<div id="container">
    <!-- Insert XSLT output here -->
</div>
<script>
    QP.drawLines(document.getElementById("container"));
</script>
```

## Browser Support

html-query-plan uses `display: table` and so won't layout correctly in IE7 or earlier.

The `<canvas>` element is used to draw lines between nodes, so these lines will only show in browsers with canvas support (IE9+).

## Icons

The icons used are adapted from the Fat Cow "Farm Fresh" web icons pack, which can be found at (http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons).  (Unfortunately some of the adapting was done by me and I'm no artist - I apologise unreservedly for mangling someone else's masterpiece)
